The problem we identified in microloan applications for the borrowers, especially for underserved communities is that there are strict credit scoring rules and long microloan approval process. Moreover, they commonly lack financial literacy and knowledge which led them to be unaware of accumulating too much debt leading to infinite debt cycle. Meanwhile, traditional microfinancial institutions who give out microloans faced lack of sufficient capitals, overcharging high interest rates and over-indebtness which allowing too many people to apply for microloan without appropriate risk scoring procedures.
Therefore: 
Our solution is primarily targeting two users : 
1) The borrowers - Underserved Communities(B40), Youth and SMEs who require microloan applications
